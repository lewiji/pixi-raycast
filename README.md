pixi-raycast
============

Simple raycaster built using Pixi.js. Requires Browserify to build - http://browserify.org/

    browserify ./js/modules/game.js -o ./js/dist/main.js

Demo: https://lewiji.github.io/pixi-raycast/

Inspired by this article: http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/ - skybox image credit to that and Dan Duriscoe.

Wolfenstein wall textures and lazy refactoring of the C++ code from this article: http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html into Javascript modules. More (and better structure/documentation) to come!

Gun sprite and animation from this thread: http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=25392
